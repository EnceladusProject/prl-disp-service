this application sends 4 STUN-packets to proxydaemon.

the use case produce memleak on proxydaemons <= 1.1-26
because  proxydaemon wouldn't release memory allocated to handle tcp streams

Proxydaemon must handle these STUNs properly and release all resources requested for tcp/udp on finish.
Expected result of proxydaemon is resident memory size after test equals size before test.


how-to run:

./memleak8745 -p 127.0.0.1 --create_slot --broker_ip 127.0.0.1

or
./memleak8745 -p 10.29.2.21 ; in this case proxydaemon must listen broker port(64777) on external interface (default is local = 127.0.0.1)

application prints additional information relates slot creation/registration on proxydaemon
user must control memory size of proxydaemon by addtional software like 'ps' or 'top'ÑŽ

recommended test case:

1. get a memory before start  by command: ps aux | grep proxydaemon
2. start sequence of 10-15 runs of memleak8745
3. wait while sequence finish
4. get a memory after test finish by command: ps aux: grep proxydaemon

memory on step1 and step4 must be equal

./memleak8745 can use uuid generated by uuidgen
